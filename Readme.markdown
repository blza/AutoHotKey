Forked verison of DisableTouchPad.ahk by PProvost. 
Unlike the original this version of DisableTouchPad.ahk supports the latest builds of AutoHotkey.

For use on laptops with a touchpad, it will disable the touchpad clicks for 0.5 seconds after you type any key. Great if, like me, you accidentally touch it while typing with your palm. As touchpads are getting bigger this small script is becoming handy for many users.

Functionality is simmilar to TouchFreeze utility.

First version of the script to my concern is taken from the post featured by [Lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/5480260/disable-your-touchpad-when-youre-typing-with-autohotkey).
