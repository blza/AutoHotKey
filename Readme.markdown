For use on laptops with a touchpad, it will disable the touchpad for 0.5 seconcs after you type any key. Great if, like me, you accidentally touch it while typing with your palm. First version of the script to my concern is taken from the post featured by [Lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/5480260/disable-your-touchpad-when-youre-typing-with-autohotkey).
